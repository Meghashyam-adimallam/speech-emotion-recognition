# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition with PyTorch + Streamlit

A Deep Learning project that recognizes **human emotions from voice** using **MFCC audio features** and a **BiLSTM model** trained on the RAVDESS dataset. The project includes a full pipeline: preprocessing, training, evaluation, and a real-time Streamlit web app.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔊 Input: `.wav` audio files (speech only)
- 🎯 Output: Predicted emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, calm...)
- 🧠 Model: Bidirectional LSTM using PyTorch
- 📊 Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- 💬 Web App: Built with Streamlit for real-time emotion detection

---

## 🧠 Emotions Detected

The model classifies audio into **8 emotion classes**:

```python
['angry', 'calm', 'disgust', 'fearful', 'happy', 'neutral', 'sad', 'surprised']

## 📊 Model Performance

* Validation Accuracy: **\~48–50%**
* Strong detection for: **angry**, **surprised**, **calm**
* Evaluated using confusion matrix + F1 scores

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* 🎤 Add microphone input support
* 📈 Improve accuracy using spectrograms or CNN layers
* ☁️ Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud
